# Business-Insights-360
     I am excited to share my learnings in Power BI project from codebasics. I have gained a lot of knowledge along the way and have had a great time working on this project. First of all, Power BI is an enhanced version of Excel. When working with huge amounts of data, creating dashboards in Power BI is quicker and easier than in Excel.
